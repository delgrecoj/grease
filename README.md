Often in Elixir you'll have lists of maps;

Then you often need to update a field on a particular entry;

> FIXME: need to mess with xmodmap to get grave key working...

Not terrible, but easy to not include the else case and lose data;

Moreover, it scales very poorly with nested data structures;

This repository is just some helpers to make that easier and less error-prone;
